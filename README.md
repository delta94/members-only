# Members Only

Message board with different user roles. All users can see the messages but to see who posted a message a user has to become a member (after creating an account) by typing in the correct password. Then the user can also become an Admin with another password so that they'll be able to delete messages.
It was made with Express, Handlebars and TailwindCSS.
